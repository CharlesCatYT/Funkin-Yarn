# Funkin' Yarn
[![Build](https://github.com/CharlesCatYT/Funkin-Yarn/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CharlesCatYT/Funkin-Yarn/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Also known as Yarn Engine, an engine based off on [Flaty Engine](https://github.com/Stilic/FNF-FlatyEngine), which was based off on [the Week 7 reverse engineering of AngelDTF](https://github.com/AngelDTF/FNF-NewgroundsPort).

_this readme is still, STILL, a wip too_


Anyway, this engine, like any other engine, adds some fixes, improvements, features, all that stuff.
It also gives a lot of customizablity, along with features for newbie coders.
